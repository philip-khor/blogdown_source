      <description>I thought I’d practice my rusty R skills when I came across a post by Khairil Yusof on the Sinar Project Facebook group that Malaysian Administrative Modernisation and Management Planning Unit (MAMPU) has made data on development expenditure over time available on data.gov.my. I haven’t paid close enough attention to government budgets to have much comments about the trends, but a comment can be found here. Tl;dr, the authors note that Malaysia’s stagnating development expenditure is concerning since Malaysia is a developing economy.</description>
